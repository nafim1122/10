Design resources and inspiration links

Use these when refining the UI, picking colors, hero images, or component patterns.

Sources provided by the user:

- uiverse (UI components gallery): https://uiverse.io/
- Dev meets Devs (design/dev resources): https://devmeetsdevs.com/
- Free images & UI resources collection: https://bootcamp.uxdesign.cc/free-images-and-resources-collection-for-website-c77f2fc46ce5
- ThemeForest (premium themes for inspiration): https://themeforest.net/
- CodeCanyon (components and paid plugins): https://codecanyon.net/

Notes / Suggestions
- Pick one visual direction (clean developer dashboard, marketplace, or blog-style docs). Keep headings, spacing and buttons consistent as per project requirements.
- Use Uiverse for small component inspiration (cards, buttons, modals).
- Use the free images list for hero/feature illustrations or ImgBB for quick image hosting.
- ThemeForest is only for inspiration — don't copy licensed theme assets directly.
- Consider adding a small `assets/` folder under `client/public` for selected free images and logos.

Recommended next steps
1. Choose one inspirational page/style (send a link) and I will adapt the color palette and a hero image.
2. I can add an `assets/` directory and include 2-3 free images (optimized) and wire them into the Home hero or a feature section.
3. If you want a specific ThemeForest template adapted, tell me which demo and I'll implement a minimal adaptation (structure and colors only).

Accessibility
- Keep button contrast and font sizes readable. I set a 1.6 line-height for paragraphs already.

Contact me with which direction you'd like and I'll implement it (hero, palette, and 2-page style).
